	Description: 
Our project was a version of the childhood game MASH where a user can input potential options for future life 
aspects and then a randomly generated “future” is created. This future consists of data that we invented. 
Most of the fun of MASH comes from the crazy data that people come up with. As a result, you are able to write 
to the text file which will add more possibilities to the game. 

ORDER OF COMMANDS:

Enter in terminal “python3 MASH.py  MASH.txt”
ENTER either “1” or “2” to either play MASH or to add an entry
If the entry is “2” enter either “Y” or “N”.
If the entry is “Y” enter text in the format required by the prompt.
If the entry is “N” the game ends.

If you want to play again, you must run the code.
